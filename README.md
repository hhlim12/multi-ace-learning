# 🧠 Multi-ACE Learning Roadmap

This repository contains structured learning materials, notes, and example code to understand
**"The design space of E(3)-equivariant atom-centred interatomic potentials" (Batatia et al., 2025)**.

Refer to the detailed roadmap and study plan in the main README for conceptual flow.
