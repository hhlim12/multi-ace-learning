# 03 – MACE Architecture

This phase covers the **Multiplicative Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE)** model — the neural, equivariant generalization of ACE.

## Contents
- `00_read_mace_paper_summary.md` – summary of Batatia *et al.* (2023)
- `01_mace_torch_demo.ipynb` – hands-on example with `mace-torch`
- `02_mace_layer_walkthrough.py` – layer-by-layer explanation of MACE

## Learning Goals
- Understand MACE as a neural extension of ACE
- Explore message passing and tensor coupling
- Connect to the later Multi-ACE formulation
